# sbt-ghpages #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-ghpages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-ghpages)

The GitHub Pages plugin for sbt makes it simple to publish a project website to
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

First, you need a site to publish, or you may wish to start simply with your
project's Scaladoc API documentation. The [sbt-site plugin] has you covered: it
can help to manage several popular static site generation tools automatically
from sbt.

Start by setting up `sbt-site`, and once you have it locally generating a site
and/or Scaladoc to your liking, `sbt-ghpages` will integrate to publish it on
the web with GitHub Pages where it will be served at
`http://{your username}.github.io/{your project}/`.

## Adding the plugin to your project ##

*Note, sbt-ghpages now requires the use of sbt version 0.13.5 or greater.*

Create a `project/ghpages.sbt` file that looks like the following:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-ghpages" % "0.6.1")
```

Then in your `build.sbt` file, simply enable the GhpagesPlugin via an
`enablePlugins` statement for your project, and specify the location of
your github repository (for more information on enabling and disabling sbt plugins,
see the [sbt plugin documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Using-Plugins.html#Enabling+and+disabling+auto+plugins)):

```scala
enablePlugins(GhpagesPlugin)

git.remoteRepo := "git@github.com:{your username}/{your project}.git"
```
### Settings

sbt-ghpages provides the following optional setting keys for use in your `build.sbt` file:

- `ghpagesRepository` - Location of the sandbox repository to be used to check out the gh-pages branch.
- `ghpagesNoJekyll` - If set to true will cause a .nojekyll file to be generated, to prevent GitHub from running Jekyll on pushed sites.
- `ghpagesBranch` - Name of the branch in which to store static files. Defaults to gh-pages.


## Initializing the gh-pages branch ##

GitHub Pages works by processing the contents of a special branch in your
project repository named `gh-pages` and then serving your static files.

Before using `sbt-ghpages`, you must [create the `gh-pages` branch in your
repository][create branch] and push the branch to GitHub. The quick steps are:

    # Using a fresh, temporary clone is safest for this procedure
    $ pushd /tmp
    $ git clone git@github.com:youruser/yourproject.git
    $ cd yourproject

    # Create branch with no history or content
    $ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    $ git rm -rf .

    # Establish the branch existence
    $ git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialize gh-pages branch"
    $ git push origin gh-pages

    # Return to original working copy clone, we're finished with the /tmp one
    $ popd
    $ rm -rf /tmp/yourproject

Now that this is done, you can begin using the plugin with sbt.

## Publishing your site ##

Simply run the `ghpagesPushSite` task to publish your website.

### How it works

Behind the scenes, `sbt-ghpages` will create a new "sandbox" clone of your Git
repository, with its location determined by the `GhPages.repository` setting key
(by default set to a directory under `~/.sbt/ghpages`). Whenever you run `sbt ghpagesPushSite`
it will copy your site content into that sandbox repository, commit it to the
`gh-pages` branch, and push the branch to GitHub.

The sandbox repo approach spares you from doing the `gh-pages` checkout/commit
dance yourself each time you update your site content, while avoiding any
mistakes with dirty or untracked files in your normal working copy clone.


## Publishing Scaladoc

A common use for `sbt-ghpages` is to automate the publishing of Scaladoc. If you wish to
use it for this, first ask `sbt-site` to generate your Scaladoc by adding an `enablePlugins` directive
for the `SiteScaladocPlugin` (included in sbt-site) to your `build.sbt` see the
[sbt-site documentation](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site#scaladoc-apis) for more information:

```scala
enablePlugins(SiteScaladocPlugin)
```

After using `ghpagesPushSite` you should find your Scaladoc at:

`http://{your username}.github.io/{your project}/latest/api`

If you aren't publishing any other content to the root of your project site, it
is recommended that you add a redirect to provide a better experience for users
visiting it. You can do this by creating a page in `src/site/index.html` that
automatically redirects to either the above link, or even better, to a good
starting point in your documentation. Otherwise, people visiting `http://{your
username}.github.io/{your project}` will just get a 404.

Here's an example `src/site/index.html` you can use as a starting point:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Project Documentation</title>
    <script language="JavaScript">
    <!--
    function doRedirect()
    {
        window.location.replace("latest/api");
    }

    doRedirect();
    //-->
    </script>
</head>
<body>
<a href="latest/api">Go to the project documentation
</a>
</body>
</html>
```

## Protecting Existing Files
The default behaviour of sbt-ghpages is to remove all existing files in the Github Pages repository
prior to publishing current pages. sbt-ghpages supports customisation of this behaviour via the provided
`includeFilter in ghpagesCleanSite` and/or `excludeFilter in ghpagesCleanSite` setting keys.

sbt-ghpages will only delete files which are matched by the FileFilter specified by the
`includeFilter in ghpagesCleanSite` setting key AND are not matched by the FileFilter specified by the
`excludeFilter in ghpagesCleanSite` key.

For example, to prevent sbt-ghpages from deleting the "CNAME" file located at the root of your site, and any file
named "versions.html", add the following to your build.sbt:

```scala
excludeFilter in ghpagesCleanSite :=
  new FileFilter{
    def accept(f: File) = (ghpagesRepository.value / "CNAME").getCanonicalPath == f.getCanonicalPath
  } || "versions.html"
```

For more information on creating more complex filters, please refer to the [sbt FileFilter documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Paths.html#File+Filters).
